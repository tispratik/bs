Recurrence

DESCRIPTION:
------------

A simple library to handle recurring events.


INSTALLATION:
-------------

Recurrence can be installed as Rails plugin or gem. To install it as gem, just
run the command 

	sudo gem install fnando-recurrence --source=http://gems.github.com

Sometimes Github just won't build the gem. You can then do the following

	git clone git://github.com/fnando/recurrence.git
	cd recurrence
	rake gem:install

If you prefer it as a plugin, just run the command

	script/plugin install git://github.com/fnando/recurrence.git

USAGE:
------
	
	require 'rubygems'
	require 'recurrence'
	
	# Daily
	r = Recurrence.new(:every => :day)
	r = Recurrence.new(:every => :day, :interval => 9)
	
	# Weekly
	r = Recurrence.new(:every => :week, :on => 5)
	r = Recurrence.new(:every => :week, :on => :monday)
	r = Recurrence.new(:every => :week, :on => [:monday, :friday])
	r = Recurrence.new(:every => :week, :on => [:monday, :wednesday, :friday])
	r = Recurrence.new(:every => :week, :on => :friday, :interval => 2)
	
	# Monthly by month day
	r = Recurrence.new(:every => :month, :on => 15)
	r = Recurrence.new(:every => :month, :on => 31)
	r = Recurrence.new(:every => :month, :on => 7, :interval => 2)
	r = Recurrence.new(:every => :month, :on => 7, :interval => :monthly)
	r = Recurrence.new(:every => :month, :on => 7, :interval => :bimonthly)
	
	# Monthly by week day
	r = Recurrence.new(:every => :month, :on => :first, :weekday => :sunday)
	r = Recurrence.new(:every => :month, :on => :third, :weekday => :monday)
	r = Recurrence.new(:every => :month, :on => :last,  :weekday => :friday)
	r = Recurrence.new(:every => :month, :on => :last,  :weekday => :friday, :interval => 2)
	r = Recurrence.new(:every => :month, :on => :last,  :weekday => :friday, :interval => :quarterly)
	r = Recurrence.new(:every => :month, :on => :last,  :weekday => :friday, :interval => :semesterly)
	
	# Yearly
	r = Recurrence.new(:every => :year, :on => [7, 4]) # => [month, day]
	r = Recurrence.new(:every => :year, :on => [10, 31], :interval => 3)
	r = Recurrence.new(:every => :year, :on => [:jan, 31])
	r = Recurrence.new(:every => :year, :on => [:january, 31])
	
	# Limit recurrence
	# :starts defaults to Date.today
	# :until defaults to 2037-12-31
	r = Recurrence.new(:every => :day, :starts => Date.today)
	r = Recurrence.new(:every => :day, :until => '2010-01-31')
	r = Recurrence.new(:every => :day, :starts => Date.today, :until => '2010-01-31')
	
	# Getting an array with all events
	r.events.each {|date| puts date.to_s }  # => Memoized array
	r.events!.each {|date| puts date.to_s } # => reset items cache and re-execute it
	r.events(:starts => '2009-01-01').each {|date| puts date.to_s }
	r.events(:until => '2009-01-10').each {|date| puts date.to_s }
	r.events(:starts => '2009-01-05', :until => '2009-01-10').each {|date| puts date.to_s }
	
	# Iterating events
	r.each { |date| puts date.to_s } # => Use items method
	r.each! { |date| puts date.to_s } # => Use items! method
	
	# Check if a date is included
	r.include?(Date.today) # => true or false
	r.include?('2008-09-21')
	
	# Get next available date
	r.next 	# => Keep the original date object
	r.next! # => Change the internal date object to the next available date
